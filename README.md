# The-Red-Side-Experience
Final Project for DSC 80 at UCSD

## Introduction
The League of Legends dataset I have chosen essentially goes over many different points of data from esports games from the year of 2024. It gives a high level statistical analysis of what goes on in a League of Legends esports game. The question I have opted to focus on was whether or not red side bot laner have an inherent advantage in the 2024 season due to map changes. The reason this is important, specifically to me and other enjoyers of the esport, is that there may be a violation of competitive integrity if this were to be the case. This being the biggest esport in the world means that this is an issue that needs to be solved if it is present. There are 26,940 rows of data in the dataset for 2024. The columns that I believe were the most relevant to my dataset were those that have stats relevant to showing whether someone has inherent differences in stats. So the columns I wanted to look into were 'csat10', 'goldat10', 'xpat10', 'csdiffat10', 'golddiffat10', 'xpdiffat10' and those diff rows at 15 minutes. Essentially, the numbers at the end of these columns describe the timing in game time when they were taken, and are a good way to see whether one person has an inherent advantage due to map because the game is isolated to a person's respective side of the map at this point in the game. The reason I used diff as well as the normal values was to get a more compounded look of whether someone was doing bad into their opponent.
